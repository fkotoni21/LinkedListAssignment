# LinkedListAssignment
Self-explanatory, but it's an assignment I made for CEN110 (C Programming) in CodeBlocks.

Here are the operations it can perform:
* Prepend (insert element at beginning)
* Append (insert element at end)
* Insert, then sort all elements
* Insert element at any position
* Delete first element from list
* Delete last element from list
* Delete specific element from list
* Delete element at any position
* Display all elements
* Total number of elements

For convenience, I called the elements "IDs" in the program.
